The world we live in is very complex and can sometimes be overwhelming too. There are so many things to keep a track of...

- Is the weather going to be okay?
- Hows the traffic to work today?
- Are my stocks performing well?
- What tasks do I need to keep up to date on?
- Are the kids doing their chores?

And the list goes on and on and on.

Sure the notifications and the apps sort of help. But do they really? All that information is good when you really want to dedicate heaps of time to do the analysis and understand what is actually happening. But in our busy worlds, we need something easier. Simpler. Something that will actually give us the most important information to keep tabs on how something is going.

That is what drove us here at Trioed to create StatusWolf. And we did it in 24hrs during the <a href="http://angelhack.com/hackathon/sydney-2015/">Sydney AngelHack hackathon</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.bluechilli.com/blog/angelhack-sydney-2015-a-raging-success/">BlueChilli</a>. 

StatusWolf is the way we believe everyone should be able to have a quick glance at something that is important to them. StatusWolf doesnt provide you the full detail, what it provides is the quick 2 second glance you need to see how things are going.

How you say? Well thats easy too. We use a simple traffic light system.

- Green for "it's looking good";
- Yellow for "hmm this might need your attention"; and 
- Red for "holy crap, this definitely needs your attention"

It's so simple. And thats what we wanted to ensure we kept. Simplicity. The look, feel and user experience was designed with the least amount of interaction in mind. It should be so easy for you to open StatusWolf and easily see how things are going. And it can be anything.

We have developed a platform and API that will allow for anything to be tracked. Currently we have developed status trackers for:

- tasks
- parcels; and
- website availability

We are currently working away at developing further trackers for:

- weather; and
- stock prices

But it doesnt stop their. Our wolf pack is scrummaging away at finding new status trackers to track too. The ones that are really important to your every day lives such as:

- Google Traffic
- JIRA tasks
- Harvest tasks
- Basecamp tasks
- Google keep notes
- iCloud reminders

Once we have refined the system and the API, we will open the API to allow for others to create status tracker connections too.

Until then, send us an email at statuswolf.io@gmail.com and we will have the wolf pack look at your request and start developing the connections.

Keep on howling!!
